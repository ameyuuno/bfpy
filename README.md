## About

This project was started with the only purpose of trying different tools (Earthly, some functionality of GitHub Actions,
PyTest, Radon, Poetry, etc.). Don't think that there is some interesting implementation of the brainfuck language. I 
just wanted to start with something simple to focus on the tools.
